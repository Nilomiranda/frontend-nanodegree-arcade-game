## Running
To run the game, just download the ZIP file or clone the project in your computer.

After that, open `index.html` file in your browser and your game should render.

## Playing
To control your character you just need to use the arrow keys in your keyboard

- Arrow left: moves your character to the left
- Arrow right: moves your character to the right
- Arrow up: moves your character up
- Arrow down: moves your character down

The game is really simple. All you have to do is move your character until you reach
the water, but be careful! There are enemies crossing the stone road and you *must* avoid them.

If the enemy hits you, you'll start all over again.
